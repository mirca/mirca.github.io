The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, or simply ADMM,
is a powerful optimization algorithm that has received tremendous attention
since publication of the book
*Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers*
by Stephen Boyd and friends in 2011, which has over 14000 citations as of Jan. 2021.

In the Fall of 2020, I gave a short lecture about ADMM as part of the Convex Optimization course at
HKUST.  My slides are online at [mirca/admm-talk](https://github.com/mirca/admm-talk). Enjoy :)!
