description: ending 2020 by starting a blog
---

I decided to start a blog on the last day of 2020. I know, this could be a horrible idea, but well let's
see where this goes.

I plan to blog mostly about three things:
* Mandarin Chinese language (yes, one of my goals for 2021 is to be able to at least hold a basic conversation in an university setting with my mainland-Chinese labmates)
* Open-water swimming and sea activities
* My research on learning graphical models with applications to financial markets

Hope in 2021 I will be a better student, a better researcher, a better friend, and a better swimmer.

That's all so far for my first blog post, I need to get going for New Year's celebration with my friend Pedro.

Bye!
