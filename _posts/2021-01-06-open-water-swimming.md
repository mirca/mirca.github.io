description: enjoying open-water swimming responsibly

*Disclaimer: I’m not a professional swimmer, I only swim casually on a weekly basis in the sea next to where I live.*

I just want to share a few bits of information that I think are valuable for beginners in order to enjoy swimming in the sea.
All these tips are centered at one common principle: safety first.
I believe that once your safety and the safety of others are considered as the most important thing in the sea,
then you can truly enjoy and have a fun time swimming.

So, let’s go:

**tip 1. buy a swimming buoy**

I cannot stress enough the importance of having a swimming buoy before endeavouring into open-water swimming.
It is a must have equipment that provides at least three major functionalities:

1. it helps others (speed boats, jet skis, etc) to be aware of your location in the water which is critical to avoid collision;

2. it increases your buoyancy and can be used as floating devices in case of injury;

3. it serves as dry bag where you can store belongings and food.

**tip 2. know your surroundings**

I found it extremely important to study about the marine life that inhabits the waters I intend to go into.
In that way, I'll know what to expect and how to react in case of an encounter with a live being.
I have been lucky to only meet unharmful creatures, most commonly fish, and a rare sighting of a stingray.

**tip 3. never swim alone**

Always have someone either swimming along with you or monitoring you at all times. We never know when we will need assistance
or in case something unexpected happens.

That's all for now folks :)
