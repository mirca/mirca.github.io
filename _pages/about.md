Hi there!

I graduated with a PhD from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at HKUST, in sunny Hong Kong,
where I was a member of the [Convex Optimization in Finance Group](https://github.com/convexfi).

My PhD research focused on problems involving [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and financial
time series, where I designed [optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) combined with elements of
[graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and
[statistical learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory),
to extract knowledge from networks of financial assets.
Our research results during my PhD were published in venues such as
NeurIPS, ICML, JMLR, AISTATS, and AAAI. I also served as a reviewer for NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, JMLR, and IEEE TNNLS.

I have done a number of internships along the way:

* equity quant at [Merrill Lynch (Bank of America)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch/): wrote code for portfolio risk optimization and limit order book forecasting;
* research scientist at [Shell Street Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shell-street-labs/about/): wrote code for portfolio strategy optimization;
* scientific software engineer at [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1529/meet-the-kepler-mission-team/): part of the lead developers team of [lightkurve](https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve), an open source package for time series analysis of NASA [Kepler, K2](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html), & [TESS](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/tess/) data;
* Google Summer of Code developer for [OpenAstronomy](https://www.openastronomy.org): improved the point spread function photometry capabilities of [photutils](https://github.com/astropy/photutils/graphs/contributors);
* guest researcher at [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov): research on nanophotonics published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00987-6) and [Review of Scientific Instruments](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4976578);

I'll be joining Merrill Lynch on August 2023 as an equity trader on the Central Risk Book desk.
