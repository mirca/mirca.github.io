Hi there! My name is Zé Vinícius, I'm a PhD candidate at HKUST, in sunny Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Daniel Palomar](https://github.com/dppalomar)
on interesting problems involving [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and financial time series.
More precisely, I use elements of graph theory and statistical learning theory to extract knowledge from networks of financial assets.
Previously, I was a scientific software engineer intern
at [NASA](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1529/meet-the-kepler-mission-team/), in Mountain View, California,
and [NIST](https://www.nist.gov). I was a Google Summer of Code student for [OpenAstronomy](https://www.openastronomy.org).

I spend most of my time doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ilvNpCoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
and [coding](https://github.com/mirca) that thing [dppalomar](https://github.com/dppalomar) asked about.
In my free time, there is nothing better for me than swimming and crab hunting in the waters of Clear Water Bay and video-chatting with my dog, Pluto.
