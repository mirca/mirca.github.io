Hi there! I'm Zé Vinícius, a PhD candidate at HKUST, in sunny Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Daniel Palomar](https://github.com/dppalomar)
on interesting problems involving [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and financial time series.
I design [optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) using elements of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and [statistical learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory)
to extract knowledge from networks of financial assets.

I have done a few internships along the way:

* equity quant at [Merrill Lynch](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch/): wrote code for portfolio risk optimization and limit order book forecasting;
* research scientist at [Shell Street Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shell-street-labs/about/): wrote code for portfolio strategy optimization;
* scientific software engineer at [NASA](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1529/meet-the-kepler-mission-team/): wrote code for [lightkurve](https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve);
* Google Summer of Code developer for [OpenAstronomy](https://www.openastronomy.org): improved the point spread function photometry capabilities of [photutils](https://github.com/astropy/photutils/graphs/contributors);
* guest researcher at [NIST](https://www/nist.gov): research on nanophotonics published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00987-6);

I spend most of my time doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ilvNpCoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
and [coding](https://github.com/mirca). In my free time, there is nothing better than swimming and crab hunting in the waters
of Clear Water Bay and video-chatting with my nephew Chico and my dog Pluto.
