Zé Vinícius is a PhD candidate at HKUST, in sunny Hong Kong, working with [Prof. Daniel Palomar](https://github.com/dppalomar)
on interesting problems involving graphs and financial time series. Previously, he was a scientific software engineer intern
at [NASA](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1529/meet-the-kepler-mission-team/), in Mountain View, California,
and [NIST](https://www.nist.gov). He was a Google Summer of Code student for [OpenAstronomy](https://www.openastronomy.org) in 2016.

He spends most of his time doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ilvNpCoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
and [coding](https://github.com/mirca) that thing [dppalomar](https://github.com/dppalomar) asked about.
In his free time, there is nothing better for him than swimming and crab hunting in the waters of Clear Water Bay and video-chatting with his dog, Pluto.
